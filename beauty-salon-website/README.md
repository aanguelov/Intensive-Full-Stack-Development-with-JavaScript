# Beauty Salon Website v 1.0.0
This project is a website for a Beauty salon. It provides information for different procedures and allows users to
register and to make an appointment (not implemented yet). Also allows the administrators to manage the procedures and
users. The system will be developed as a Single Page Application (SPA) using React.js and react-router as front-end,
and Node.js + hapi + json-based database as backend technologies.
## Project Configuration
At the moment the project uses json-based database, so you don`t have to do anything about configuring it.
## Running The Demo
In order to start the project install latest Node.js, navigate to the project`s folder in the console and run:
```
npm install
```
This will install the node_modules folder, where are all the dependencies for this project. Next you have to start the
server. Run this command in the console:
```
npm run services
```
This will start the project`s server which will be listening on port 9000. Next you have to start the project`s API.
Open another console and run:
```
npm start
```
The project is now live on localhost:3000
